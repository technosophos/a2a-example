# Example A2A Agent

This is a Spin app written in TypeScript that provides an A2A agent.

* The agent is asynchronous (not streamed)
* It is a one-shot agent, and doesn't use sessions
* It's _definitely_ not production ready

## To Build:

Make sure you have a recent version of Spin and of NPM.

* Clone this repository
* Run `spin build --up` to build and start a local verison
